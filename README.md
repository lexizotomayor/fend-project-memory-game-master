# Memory Game Project

This is a matching game that relies on the playerâ€™s quick ability to remember the cards she or he flips, and matches them, until all cards have been flipped.

## Basic Rules

This memory game has a deck of 16 cards with logos on the other side. The objective is to flip all the cards, pairing two cards, at a time, with the same logos.

The player clicks on one card, flips it over. Then clicks another. If the logos match, the two cards remain open.
If the first clicked card does not match with the second, the cards return to their face down position.
Note the timer ticks and the longer it takes for player to find a pair, the star rating also goes down.  
Once player completes the game, a pop-up modal opens up, congratulates the player for doing so, and logs the number of moves and the time it took the player to complete the game. 
There is no limit to the number of games the player can play.  Once all cards are flipped the player can simply click restart either on the modal or on the score panel. 
Should there be any bug in the game, contact the developer via [e-Mail](mailto:lexi@zotomayor.com).
